I had luxuriant locks, and the temple was still standing, when I originally started the notes on category theory. But here we are … (according to ChatGPT, channelling its inner Rembrandt). The history of earlier versions is embarrassingly untidy...

Computational Complexity --- 6/19/2025

A year ago if I showed you a picture of The Pope wearing a Baseball cap for the Chicago White Sox (or any Amercan team) you would assume it was computer-generated. And you would likely be right. Are there any real pictures of any Pope before Pope...
