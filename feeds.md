Computational Complexity --- 10/21/2025

Several people emailed me that September 16, 2025---written as 9-16-25 in the US---represents the integer side lengths of a right triangle.9-16-25 is the only such triple that is also a valid date. This kind of mathematical alignment only happens...

Abuse of Notation --- 10/16/2025

In my last post about generality, I tried to show how our ambition to discover ideas that are all-encompassing and eternal makes our worldview crumble, leaving us unable to think clearly even about simple issues with obvious solutions. Today, I...

“My life is like a prison” I wrote this in my personal website when I was 14. I was quite correct in pinpointing the problem, pinpointing how I, and many other people, felt, but I was off at identifying the cause — I thought, that I was kept in...
