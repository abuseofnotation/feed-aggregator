In Jan of 2023 I estabalished the Betty White Award, see here which is given to people who died late in the prior year and hence won't be in the those who we lost in year X articles. I also gave out a few from prior years. Here are past winners,...

The Hyperfixed Podcast had a lovely episode recently about tape measures. It started from “why does my tape measure seem to always be off a little bit” and went all the way to the inherent limitations of physical measurement at small scales. In...

Computational Complexity --- 12/23/2024

Back in the day (circa 1989) we studied locally random reductions which would lead to all those exciting interactive proof results. Somehow locally random reductions got rebranded as locally correctable codes and this year's result of the year...

More detail on the Cycle Length Lemma, a basic result in the theory of random permutations.  We prove a categorified version of this result, which is an equivalence of groupoids, and then derive the original version by taking groupoid cardinalities.
