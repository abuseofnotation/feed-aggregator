Computational Complexity --- 5/20/2025

There have been times when satire has been mistaken for reality. A list of Onion stories that were mistaken for reality (or was it a mistake?) is here. When I say mistaken for reality I mean that a large set of people were fooled.My own...

Computational Complexity --- 5/20/2025

The New Pope is Pope Leo XIV (pre-Pope name is Robert Prevost). 1) Pope names are one of the few places we still use Roman Numerals. I saw an article that was probably satirical that Americans prefer Roman Numerals (the numbers Jesus used) over...

Math ∩ Programming --- 5/13/2025

I was inspired to browse some of Edsger Dijkstra’s essays today, and came across his speech, “Under the spell of Leibniz’s Dream”. It’s the sort of personal history I love to read, which gives one person’s sense of the world over a period of...

Computational Complexity --- 5/8/2025

I reviewed a paper recently and I had to agree not to use AI in any aspect of the reviewing process. So I didn't but it felt strange, like I wouldn't be able to use a calculator to check calculations in a paper. Large language models aren't perfect...
