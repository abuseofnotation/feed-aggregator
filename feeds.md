Computational Complexity --- 10/27/2025

I sometimes give the following advice for research which I label Bill's Bad Advice. We will later see who it might be good advice for. Spoiler alert: the number of people for whom it is good advice is shrinking but might include Lance especially...

Several people emailed me that September 16, 2025---written as 9-16-25 in the US---represents the integer side lengths of a right triangle.9-16-25 is the only such triple that is also a valid date. This kind of mathematical alignment only happens...

Abuse of Notation --- 10/16/2025

In my last post about generality, I tried to show how our ambition to discover ideas that are all-encompassing and eternal makes our worldview crumble, leaving us unable to think clearly even about simple issues with obvious solutions. Today, I...

Computational Complexity --- 10/5/2025

You used AI in your work. Do you hide it or brag about it? 1) In 2002 there was a movie Simone about an actress who is really an AI. The Wikipedia entry tells the entire plot. I saved time by reading it in two minutes rather than watching it in 2...
