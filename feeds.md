Abuse of Notation --- 5/27/2025

I want to forget Gaza. I want to forget the pain. I want to forget all dumb jokes, old song lyrics. I want to forget that most things ever happened, as remembering makes everything tedious. Forces you to become a bureaucrat of your memories, to...

Abuse of Notation --- 5/27/2025

Every time you eat mushrooms, I have to try them too. Cause, if the mushrooms turn out to be poisonous and you die of slow and painful dead, I will die as well. I once dreamed that I was dying, You were beside me, I turned to you and said, “I don’t...

Abuse of Notation --- 5/27/2025

The road I walk is new. It’s made not of stone, but dirt. There are no road signs yet. And no bridges to cover the rivers. The road I walk is new, so people think that it is hard. “How do swim?” “Don’t you get dirty?” “How do you cope with all that...

(Trivia: What song has the lyric Some are Mathematicians, some are Carpenters's wives ? It's not a parody song, though sometimes it's hard to tell a parody song from a so-called real song.)In my post about Pope Leo XIV I made the following...


[Using Automorphism Groups of Curves to Control the Slopes of their Jacobians](https://rin.io/gausssums/)

Good Fibrations --- 5/23/2025

I’ve felt for a long time that automorphisms of curves should control or at least exert serious force on the slopes on their Jacobians. Symmetry forces height, as I’ve written about previously in Models of Formal Groups Laws of Every Height, and...

The New Pope is Pope Leo XIV (pre-Pope name is Robert Prevost). 1) Pope names are one of the few places we still use Roman Numerals. I saw an article that was probably satirical that Americans prefer Roman Numerals (the numbers Jesus used) over...
