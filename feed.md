Good Fibrations --- 5/6/2024

We outline connections between the gut microbiome, autoimmune conditions, neuropathic pain, eye pain, chemical intolerance, and a specific set of “overactive” mental illnesses. All seem to be connected to a sensory processing disorder. This is...


[Half Haunted: The 1/2 in Harish-Chandra via the Fourier Transform](https://rin.io/fourier-harish-chandra/)
---

Good Fibrations --- 12/31/2023

This post is written together with Josh Mundinger. Last time, we compared the Harish-Chandra isomorphism \(Z(U\mathfrak g) \cong (\text{Sym} \mathfrak h)^{W,\cdot}\) for \(\mathfrak g= \mathfrak{sl}_2\) to the Duflo isomorphism \(Z(U\mathfrak g)...


[Half Haunted: Relating the 1/2’s in Duflo and Harish-Chandra](https://rin.io/harish-chandra/)
---

Good Fibrations --- 9/16/2023

This post is written together with Josh Mundinger. We seek to understand the relations between \(1/2\)’s that appear across mathematics. From the Riemann Hypothesis to the L2 norm, we aim to see the myriad and enticing ways this unfurls; each...


[Stop Staring and Compute! Automorphism Groups of Rational Curves](https://rin.io/stop-staring-and-compute-automorphism-groups-of-curves/)
---

Good Fibrations --- 2/23/2022

Let’s compute the automorphism groups of some curves. Often presented as an insurmountable task, we must couragously go forward. There are many ways to do this! We will be using 3 different algorithms, so choose according to your taste. If you do...

Please enjoy my webcomic on what it feels like to run into a concept for the first time. I will be updating panel by panel, adding each one to this post as I make them. Here begins the adventures of Massey into the unknown.


[Hecke orbits and Homotopy](https://rin.io/heckeorbitshomotopy/)

Good Fibrations --- 1/7/2020

I thought it might be of interest to homotopy theorists to learn how the Lubin-Tate action is relevant in the Hecke orbit conjecture. Here is a beginner friendly summary. heckeorbitshomotopy


[Honda, Taira, On the Formal Structure of the Jacobian Variety of the Fermat Curve over a (p)-adic Integer Ring](https://rin.io/formal-group-of-jacobian-of-fermat-curve/)
---

Good Fibrations --- 11/26/2019

This paper of Honda was very hard for me to track down. I found it in a retired library volume in a thrift store in England. It was not previously available digitally. Hopefully, this digital copy will make it easier for others to enjoy Honda’s...


[Overview of the Classic Theory of p-Divisible groups](https://rin.io/overview-of-the-classic-theory-of-p-divisible-groups/)
---

Good Fibrations --- 4/10/2019

Here are the texed notes for my 1 hour oberwolfach talk (the key thing I left out is Cartier duality). I included Manin’s original approach, and remark on some details I find left out of most sources.


[Automorphisms of the Jacobian](https://rin.io/aut-jac/)
---

Good Fibrations --- 12/31/2018

Here, \(A\) is any abelian variety. This post consists of the backstory of my latest paper with Dami Lee and something interesting I learned about the relationship between the size of \(Aut(A)\), and the number of principal polarizations \(A\) has.


[Fiber Bundles of Formal Disks](https://rin.io/fiber-bundles-of-formal-disks/)
---

Good Fibrations --- 12/31/2018

Here is an incomplete proof that varieties are fiber bundles of formal disks over their deRham Stacks. The fact makes intuitive sense, the deRham stack is the variety without infinitesimal data, and then by adding the infinitesimal data (formal...
